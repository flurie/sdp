  Many data structures allow you to represent almost equivalent values in many
  ways. For example, an array with an optional @offset@ field allows you to
  slice subarray quickly and with minimal memory overhead. But original array
  with all of its contents remains in memory and there is no easy way to
  determine which part of the memory in use now (or potentially), and which part
  can be freed. In this case, 'force' allows you to use fast split and slice
  operations, but you can slow down these functions if necessary to improve the
  efficiency of your code.
  
  Note that there is no universal set of rules that a 'force' implementation
  must follow, for example, it can always create a new structure, or sometimes
  refer to an old one (part of it), so you cannot use @unsafeThaw@ and other
  similar operations after 'force' if you are working with generic types.

  The list doesn't imply variations in value representation and don't cause
  memory, so 'force' is just 'id'.
